*   **Goal:** Rewrite existing streamline skin into modern html , css,Javascript based web app. 
*   **Core Features:** using reaprime as middle ware to talk to decent espresso machine and control it, and display real time data, and allow for profile creation and management.
*.  **Reference**:** All UI and Design reference can be accessed via figna design file and DESIGN_SYSTEM.MD. 
## 2. Tech Stack

*   **Framework:** Javascript , html , css
*   **Language:** Javascript
*   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS,daisyUI 
*   **UI Components:** plotly.js for charting

## 3. Project Structure

A brief description of key directories to help with navigation.

    - get_code
    - get_code_connect_map
    - get_image
    - get_metadata
    - get_variable_defs

    Prompts:
    - create_design_system_rules
    - get_code_for_selection
    - map_selection_to_code_connect

## 5. Coding Reference

Current Working example is at /Users/markc/Documents/streamline_js/de1app/de1plus/skins/Streamline main functionality is written in skin.tcl , if you are not sure how to implement certain feature in Javascript, check aginst the logic in skin.tcl before you implement. 
You are also required to check reaprime_api.md and rewrite_roadmap.md in your reasoning. These documents serve as guidelines for the project.
## 6. Current Goal

* * bug fixes and code suggestions. 
## Gemini Added Memories
- When updating Plotly charts, use Plotly.update() instead of Plotly.react() for better performance.
